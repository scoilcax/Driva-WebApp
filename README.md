# Driva-WebApp
A little Uber alternative thing im working on
- Currently just a UI demo but in the future could become useable
- I'm struggling with OSRM routing i want to disallow ferry crossings and stop routing if a route is not possible without ferry crossings. :/
- Due to the static nature of the app if I want to make it functional I'd have to make a closed source version to hide private keys and tbh it would probably not get many users but honestly I just made this because uber to expensive!
## Patchnotes:
- Removed need for API keys
